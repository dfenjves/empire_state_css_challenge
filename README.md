#The Empire State Building CSS Challenge

As a front-end web developer, one of your main responsibilities is to be able to translate mockups and layouts given to you by designers in to useable pages. They give you a 'look' and you convert that to CSS, HTML and Javascript code.

Check out the image called 'empire-state-mockup.png' in the root direcotry of this project. This is the mockup given to you by the design team at the agency that you've just started working at. It's your job to style the given HTML by using your new knowledge of CSS. To get started:

*Fork and clone the project locally.
*Open up the project in Sublime. You'll see `index.html`. Open it up and see what the document looks like. You've got some work to do!
*Navigate to the `style.css` file. This is where you'll write the css styling for your page.
